* Introduction

Here we will add muscles with neural efferent inputs and afferent
feedback, to our arm model. We will start with very simplified models of muscle force and work up to more physiologically realistic models. For the purpose of easy demonstration and simulation we will revert back to a single-joint arm model.

* Modelling simple torque muscles

** Constant Torque Muscle

In the previous section we built a model of the skeletal dynamics a
forearm. As a first step to implement "torque muscles", we will use a
simple dynamic equation of motion of a single joint arm in a vertical
plane, with gravity:

#+ATTR_HTML: width="400px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: Schematic of a simple one-joint arm in a vertical plane with one muscle.
[[file:figs/onejointarm_muscle.png]]

\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} = m g l_{z} \cos \theta + T_{m}
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the mass of the segment, $g$ is the gravitational
constant (9.81 m/s/s), $l_{z}$ is the distance of the centre of mass
from the joint, and $\theta$ and $\ddot{\theta}$ are joint angular
position and acceleration, respectively. The new term we are now
adding, $T_{m}$, is the net joint torque due to muscle contraction.

Here is what a simple Python function would look like for simulating these dynamics:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def onejointmuscle(state,t,Tm):
  m = 1.65    # kg
  g = -9.81   # m/s/s
  l = 0.179   # metres
  I = 0.0779  # kg m**2
  a = state[0]
  ad = state[1]
  add = (m*g*lz*cos(a) + Tm) / I
  return [ad,add]
#+END_SRC

You can download a full program here that implements a simulation and animation of this version of the arm:

[[file:code/onejointmuscle_1.py][onejointmuscle\_1.py]]

*** Questions

1. Play with the $T_{m}$ parameter until you arrive at a value that
   maintains the arm at an angle of 30 degrees.

2. What value of muscle torque $T_{m}$ is required to maintain the arm
   at 45 degrees?


** Two Antagonistic Torque Muscles

Now we add a second "muscle" so we have $T_{mf}$ from a "flexor"
muscle (like biceps brachii) and $T_{me}$ from an "extensor" muscle
(like triceps brachii).

#+ATTR_HTML: width="400px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: Schematic of a simple one-joint arm in a vertical plane with two antagonistic muscles.
[[file:figs/onejointarm_muscle2.png]]

Now our dynamics equation looks like this:

\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} = m g l_{z} \cos \theta + T_{mf} - T_{me}
\end{equation}

Note how the two muscles act to produce torque in opposite directions.

Here is a new version of the Python function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def onejointmuscle(state,t,Tmf,Tme):
  m = 1.65    # kg
  g = -9.81   # m/s/s
  lz = 0.179  # metres
  I = 0.0779  # kg m**2
  a = state[0]
  ad = state[1]
  add = (m*g*lz*cos(a) + Tmf - Tme) / I
  return [ad,add]
#+END_SRC

You can download a full program here that implements a simulation and animation of this version of the arm:

[[file:code/onejointmuscle_2.py][onejointmuscle\_2.py]]

*** Questions

1. Say the initial position of the forearm is $\pi/4$ radians with
   zero initial velocity. What static muscle torques $T_{mf},T_{me}$
   are needed to make the arm stay put?

2. Using your answer from Question 1 as a starting point, what happens
   if you increase $T_{mf}$ and $T_{me}$ by the same amount (e.g. by
   1.0 Nm)?


** Muscles as Linear Springs
 
A very coarse approximation of muscle behaviour is that the muscles
deliver a torque that depends linearly on joint angle. This is
essentially the same as a spring:

\begin{equation}
T_{m} = -k(\theta-\theta_{0})
\end{equation}

#+ATTR_HTML: width="400px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: Schematic of a simple one-joint arm in a vertical plane with two antagonistic spring-like muscles.
[[file:figs/onejointarm_muscle3.png]]

Note that for simplicity we are ignoring muscle [[http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/ma.shtml][moment arms]] and we are
assuming they are constant with respect to joint angle.

The $\theta_{0}$ parameter is the "rest length" angle for the elbow joint angle. This is the angle at which the muscles produce no force.

You may have noticed that our spring muscles can "push" as well as pull. To fix this we adjust the muscle equation a bit:

\begin{eqnarray}
T_{flex} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{+} \\
T_{ext} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{-}
\end{eqnarray}

The notation $y=\left[x\right]^{+}$ and $y=\left[x\right]^{-}$ means
that $y$ is $x$ when $x>0$ (and zero otherwise) or $-x$ when $x<0$ (or
zero otherwise), respectively.

So the equation of motion for linear spring-like muscles is:

\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} = m g l_{z} \cos\theta + \left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{+} + \left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{-}
\end{equation}

Here is a Python function that implements this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def onejointmuscle(state,t,a0):
	m = 1.65    # kg
	g = -9.81   # m/s/s
	lz = 0.179  # metres
	I = 0.0779  # kg m**2
	k = -10.0   # Nm/rad
	a = state[0]
	ad = state[1]
	Tmf = max(k*(a-a0),0)
	Tme = min(k*(a-a0),0)
	add = (m*g*lz*cos(a) + Tmf + Tme) / I
	return [ad,add]
#+END_SRC

You can download a full program here that implements a simulation and animation of this version of the arm:

[[file:code/onejointmuscle_3.py][onejointmuscle\_3.py]]

*** Questions

1. Play with the simulation found in [[file:code/onejointmuscle_3.py][onejointmuscle\_3.py]]. Vary the
   value of =k=. What happens to the motion of the arm?

2. Vary the value of =a0=. What happens?

3. How would you change the code so that each muscle had its own
   stiffness parameter =k= and its own rest angle =a0=?


** Muscles as Linear Spring-Dampers

A better approximation (yet still too coarse for good predictions
about realistic muscle behaviour) is to incorporate a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashpot][damper]] in the
muscle. A damper is a mechanical unit that delivers an opposing force
that is proportional to velocity. It acts to "damp out" oscillations. Muscle force in a real muscle is also proportional to velocity, but in a more complex way, which we will see later. For now let's assume linear damping:

\begin{eqnarray}
T_{flex} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) + b \dot{\theta} \right]^{+} \\
T_{ext} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) + b \dot{\theta} \right]^{-}
\end{eqnarray}

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def onejointmuscle(state,t,a0):
	m = 1.65    # kg
	g = -9.81   # m/s/s
	lz = 0.179  # metres
	I = 0.0779  # kg m**2
	k = -10.0   # Nm/rad
	b =  0.5    # Nms/rad
	a = state[0]
	ad = state[1]
	Tmf = max((k*(a-a0)) - (b*ad),0)
	Tme = min((k*(a-a0)) - (b*ad),0)
	add = (m*g*lz*cos(a) + Tmf + Tme) / I
	return [ad,add]
#+END_SRC

*** Questions

1. Play with the simulation found in [[file:code/onejointmuscle_4.py][onejointmuscle\_4.py]]. Vary the
   value of =b=. What happens to the motion of the arm?

2. Can you find a combination of =k=, =b= and =a0= that makes the arm
   rest in a stable equilibrium at $\theta = -\pi/6$ radians?


* Introduction to Hill-type muscle models

In reality, muscles show way more complicated behaviour then depicted
in the last section. Over the last decades, several different types of
muscle models have been proposed in the literature. Most commonly used
are the Huxley model (Distrubuted Moments Model) and the Hill-type
muscle model. The main difference between the two models is that the
Huxley model is a structural model, whereas the Hill-type muscle model
is strictly phenomenological. Although both models have their own
specific strengths and weaknesses, in general these models both
describe the dynamic behaviour of real muscles fairly well. Hill-type
muscle models are more frequently used, mainly because they are easier
to implement.

#+ATTR_HTML: width="300px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: Schematic of a Hill-type muscle model.
[[file:figs/hillmuscle.png]]

The Hill-type muscle model is build around three elements: a parallel
elastic element (PE) a contractile element (CE) and a serial element
(SE). The PE represents the collagen tissue that is present in the
muscle belly. The CE represents the actual contractile properties of
the muscle and the SE represents all the tendinous tissue in series
with the CE. Below, a short simplified description of the elements is
provided.

** The SE

Collagen tissue is a passive material that behaves like a non-linear
spring. Although the behavior of a tendon (or aponeurosis, etc) is
quite complex, the "normal" working range is well described by a
quadratic spring:

\begin{equation}
F_{SE} = \left( \left[ k_{SE}(l_{SE_0} - l_{SE}) \right]^{+} \right)^{2}
\end{equation}

Here, $k_{SE}$ is the tendon stiffness, $l_{SE}$ the tendon length and
$l_{SE_0}$ the tendon slack length. $k_{SE}$ is usually measured in
vivo using very fast perturbations, for example using the so-called
"quick-release experiment":

- Hof, AL. In vivo measurement of the series elasticity release curve
  of human triceps surae muscle. J Biomech 1998 Sep;31(9):793-800

The slack length of tendons are muscle specific and are in general
measured in cadaver studies. Here is an example of the (relative)
force-length curve of a SE:

#+ATTR_HTML: width="250px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: The force-length curve of a SE. Force is plotted relative to the maximal isometric force of the muscle.
[[file:figs/forcelengthse.png]]

** The CE: the force-length relationship

Due to their contractile proteins (actin and myosin, etc.), muscles
are capable of actively generating force. In contrast with the Huxley
model, the Hill-type muscle model does not model the interactions of
the proteins themselves, but rather the experimentally observed
mechanical behaviour of these interactions. Two salient mechanical
phenomena are typically observed in muscles: the force-length
relationship and the force-velocity relationship. To keep things
computationally simple, without harming the descriptive power of the
model too much, the isometric force-length relationship is often
described by a parabola:

#+ATTR_HTML: width="300px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: The isometric CE force (relative to the maximum isometric force) as a function of the length of the CE. The dashed line represents the isometric force when the muscle is stimulated half the maximum. Depicted is also the PE force. Note that the l_PE is equal to l_CE. The total force-length relationship is the sum of the active CE and passive PE force-length relationship. Also shown is the passive force of the PE: a quadratic spring that is similar to that of the SE.
[[file:figs/forcelengthce.png]]

The maximal isometric force of a real muscle can be estimated from
cadaver studies by counting the amount of sarcomeres in parallel (or
measuring the physiological cross-sectional area). The optimum length
of a muscle can be estimated by counting the amount of sarcomeres in
series, see for example:

- Murray WM, Buchanan TS, and Delp SL. The isometric functional
  capacity of muscles that cross the elbow. J Biomech 33: 943-952, 200

** The CE: the force-velocity relationship

The force-velocity relationship is a bit more difficult that the
force-length relationship. This relationship describes the phenomenon
that the (maximal) force that muscles can deliver depends on the speed
with which they contract. If the muscle shortens (concentric
contraction), the maximal force decreases and if the muscle lengthens
(eccentric contraction) the maximal force increases:

#+CAPTION: The CE force as a function of the contraction velocity. The dashed line represents the force-velocity curve when the muscle is stimulated half the maximal value.
[[file:figs/forcevelocity.png]]

** Modeling the interaction between muscle and skeleton

In the previous section we have implicitly assumed that the "length"
of the torque muscles change linearly with joint angle. In reality,
the length of the whole muscle (i.e. the muscle tendon complex length
l_MTC), depends also its origin and insertion and on the anatomy of
the structures it is crossing. The relationship between l_MTC and
joint angle is obtained in cadaver studies using a very elegant
technique proposed by Grieve et al. in 1978 (Biomechanics VI-A,
International series on Biomechanics, University Park Press,
Baltimore). First, at a reference position, the l_MTC of a muscle is
measured. Then, a piece of tendon is cut out and removed, and the
distance between the two remaining parts is measured as a function of
joint angle. The obtained data gives the change of l_MTC as a function
of the angle. Together with the reference length, the kinematic
relationship between l_MTC and joint angle is known. But what about
the mechanical interaction?

The muscles deliver a torque on the skeleton. The torque delivered by
a muscle equals the force they deliver multiplied with the moment arm
(lever arm) of that muscle. But what about the moment arms of real
muscles? The nice thing about measuring l_MTC as a function of joint
angle, is that one gets the moment arm as a function of joint angle
for free! Using the principle of "virtual energy", one can easily
deduce that the moment arm equals the change in muscle length divided
by the change in joint angle (thus, the derivative of l_MTC with
respect to joint angle:

\begin{equation}
momentarm = \frac{\partial l_{MTC}}{\partial \theta}
\end{equation}

* Simulations with a musculoskeletal model

Over the last decades several changes have been suggested to improve
the predictive capacities of the Hill-type muscle model. For the
interested reader, a detailed overview of a "full-blown"
musculoskeletal model and its mathematical description can be found in:

- Kistemaker DA, Wong JD, Gribble PL (2010) The Central Nervous System
  does not minimize energy cost in arm movements. J Neurophysiol, 104,
  2985-94

#+ATTR_HTML: width="400px" align="center"
#+CAPTION: Schematic of "full-blown" musculoskeletal model found in Kistemaker et al. (2010).
[[file:figs/fullblownschematic.png]]

In addition to the Hill-type muscle model, a model of activation
dynamics is added. Activation dynamics is the process that takes place
when an action potential arrives at a muscle. This AP causes the
release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum in the intercellular
which leads to free binding places for cross-bridges between actin and
myosin. 

There are many examples in the literature of using physiologically
realistic (to varying degrees) musculoskeletal models to investigate
questions of neural control of movement, sensory-motor learning, etc,
in all sorts of model systems like arm movements, speech production,
locomotion, posture and balance, jumping, etc. Here are a few:
