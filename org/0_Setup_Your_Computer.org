* Install Options

** Option 1: Download and build source code from websites above
- good luck with that, there are many dependencies, it’s a bit of a mess

** Option 2: Install the Enthought Python Distribution (all platforms)
- your best bet may be the [[http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php][Enthought Python Distribution]]
- they have an [[http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php][Academic Version]] which is free
- also a totally free version here: [[http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php][EPD Free]]
- doesn't necessarily include latest versions of packages (e.g. iPython)

** Option 3: Install a software virtual machine running Ubuntu GNU/Linux (all platforms)
- perhaps the easiest and most "self-contained" option - it won’t
  install stuff on your own machine but will install stuff within a
  virtual machine, leaving your machine untouched
- download and install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]], it’s free and runs on Windows & Mac
  (and GNU/Linux)
- download the pre-configured [[http://www.gribblelab.org/compneuro/installers/UbuntuVM.ova][UbuntuVM.ova]] provided by me (beware,
  it’s a 3.8 GB file)
- in VirtualBox, "Import Appliance..." and point to UbuntuVM.ova
- Then start the virtual machine (username is compneuro and password is
  compneuro)
- you’re ready to rumble, I have installed all the software already

** Option 4 (Mac) : install Python + scientific libraries on your machine
- install [[http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12][Xcode]] from the mac app store (the download is LARGE, several
  GB)
- in Xcode: Preferences/Downloads/Components and Install the "Command
  Line Tools"
- download and run the [[http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/][SciPy Superpack install script]]
- note: you may have to download install [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools][python-setuptools]] first... if
  the superpack install script doesn’t work, try this
- you’re ready to rumble

** Option 5 (windows)
- <laughing>
- seriously though I have little to no idea about the windows universe
- your best bet may be the [[http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php][Enthought Python Distribution]]
- they have an [[http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php][Academic Version]] which is free, you just have to fill
  out a form and they send you an email with a download link
- here is a [[http://goo.gl/HSVPp][blog post]] detailing how to get the ipython notebook
  running on Windows 7

* Testing your installation

** Launching iPython

To launch iPython, open up a Terminal and type a command to launch:

To make it so Figures appear in their own window on your desktop (like MATLAB):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ipython --pylab
#+END_SRC

To make it so Figures appear in the console itself, right after the
commmand(s) that produced them:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ipython qtconsole --pylab inline
#+END_SRC

To launch a browser-based "notebook" (this is really neat)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ipython notebook --pylab inline
#+END_SRC

** Making a plot

Type the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
t = arange(0, 1, 0.01)
y = sin(2*pi*t*3)
plot(t,y)
#+END_SRC

and you should see this plot:

* Next steps

In the next topic we will talk about dynamical systems --- what they
are, and how they can be used to address scientific questions through
computer simulation.
