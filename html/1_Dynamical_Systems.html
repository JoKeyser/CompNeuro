<h2 id="orgheadline1">What is a dynamical system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
Systems can be characterized by the specific relation between their
input(s) and output(s). A static system has an output that only
depends on its input. A mechanical example of such a system is an
idealized, massless (mass=0) spring. The length of the spring depends
only on the force (the input) that acts upon it. Change the input
force, and the length of the spring will change, and this will happen
instantaneously (obviously a massless spring is a theoretical
construct). A system becomes dynamical (it is said to have <i>dynamics</i>
when a mass is attached to the spring. Now the position of the mass
(and equivalently, the length of the spring) is no longer directly
dependent on the input force, but is also tied to the acceleration of
the mass, which in turn depends on the sum of all forces acting upon
it (the sum of the input force and the force due to the spring). The
net force depends on the position of the mass, which depends on the
length of the spring, which depends on the spring force. The property
that acceleration of the mass depends on its position makes this a
dynamical system.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Dynamical systems can be characterized by differential equations that
relate the state derivatives (e.g. velocity or acceleration) to the
state variables (e.g. position). The differential equation for the
spring-mass system depicted above is:
</p>

\begin{equation}
m\ddot{x} = -kx + mg
\end{equation}

<p>
Where \(x\) is the position of the mass \(m\) (the length of the spring),
\(\ddot{x}\) is the second derivative of position (i.e. acceleration),
\(k\) is a constant (related to the stiffness of the spring), and \(g\) is
the graviational constant.
</p>

<p>
The system is said to be a <i>second order</i> system, as the highest
derivative that appears in the differential equation describing the
system, is two. The position \(x\) and its time derivative \(\dot{x}\) are
called <i>states</i> of the system, and \(\dot{x}\) and \(\ddot{x}\) are called
<i>state derivatives</i>.
</p>

<p>
Most systems out there in nature are dynamical systems. For example
most chemical reactions under natural circumstances are dynamical: the
rate of change of a chemical reaction depends on the amount of
chemical present, in other words the state derivative is proportional
to the state. Dynamical systems exist in biology as well. For example
the rate of change of a certain species depends on its population
size.
</p>

<p>
Dynamical equations are often described by a set of <i>coupled
  differential equations</i>. For example, the reproduction rate of
  rabbits (state derivative 1) depends on the population of rabbits
  (state 1) and on the population size of foxes (state 2). The
  reproduction rate of foxes (state derivative 2) depends on the
  population of foxes (state 2) and also on the population of rabbits
  (state 1). In this case we have two coupled first-order differential
  equations, and hence a system of order two. The so-called
  predator-prey model is also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka_Volterra_equation">Lotka-Volterra equations</a>.
</p>

\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x} &= x(\alpha - \beta y)\\
\dot{y} &= -y(\gamma - \delta x)
\end{eqnarray}

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Why make models?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
There are two main reasons: one being practical and one mostly
theoretical. The practical use is prediction. A typical example of a
dynamical system that is modelled for prediction is the weather. The
weather is a very complex, (high-order, nonlinear, coupled and
chaotic) system. More theoretically, one reason to make models is to
test the validity of a functional hypothesis of an observed
phenomenon. A beautiful example is the model made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin-Huxley_model">Hodgkin and
Huxley</a> to understand how action potentials arise and propagate in
neurons [<a href="#HH1952">1</a>,<a href="#HH1990">2</a>]. They modelled the different
(voltage-gated) ion channels in an axon membrane and showed using
mathematical models that indeed the changes in ion concentrations were
responsible for the electical spikes observed experimentally 7 years
earlierr.
</p>

</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="figs/HH2.png" alt="HH2.png" height="200px" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span> Action potentials across the membrane</p>
</div>

<p>
A second theoretical reason to make models is that it is sometimes
very difficult, if not impossible, to answer a certain question
empirically. As an example we take the following biomechanical
question: Would you be able to jump higher if your biceps femoris
(part of your hamstrings) were two separate muscles each crossing only
one joint rather than being one muscle crossing both the hip and knee
joint? Not a strange question as one could then independently control
the torques around each joint.
</p>

<p>
In order to answer this question empirically, one would like to do the
following experiment:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>measure the maximal jump height of a subject</li>
<li>change only the musculoskeletal properties in question</li>
<li>measure the jump height again</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, such an experiment would yield several major ethical,
practical and theoretical drawbacks. It is unlikely that an ethics
committee would approve the transplantation of the origin and
insertion of the hamstrings in order to examine its effect on jump
height. And even so, one would have some difficulties finding
subjects. Even with a volunteer for such a surgery it would not bring
us any closer to an answer. After such a surgery, the subject would
not be able to jump right away, but has to undergo severe revalidation
and surely during such a period many factors will undesirably change
like maximal contractile forces. And even if the subject would fully
recover (apart from the hamstrings transplantation), his or her
nervous system would have to find the new optimal muscle stimulation
pattern.
</p>

<p>
If one person jumps lower than another person, is that because she
cannot jump as high with her particular muscles, or was it just that
her CNS was not able to find the optimal muscle activation pattern?
Ultimately, one wants to know through what mechanism the subject's
jump performance changes. To investigate this, one would need to know,
for example, the forces produced by the hamstrings as a function of
time, something that is impossible to obtain experimentally. Of
course, this example is somewhat ridiculous, but its message is
hopefully clear that for several questions a strict empirical approach
is not suitable. An alternative is provided by mathematical modelling.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
In the next topic, we will be examining three systems &#x2014; a
mass-spring system, a system representing weather patterns, and a
system characterizing predator-prey interactions. In each case we will
see how to go from differential equations characterizing the dynamics
of the system, to Python code, and run that code to simulate the
behaviour of the system over time. We will see the great power of
simulation, namely the ability to change aspects of the system at
will, and simulate to explore the resulting change in system
behaviour.
