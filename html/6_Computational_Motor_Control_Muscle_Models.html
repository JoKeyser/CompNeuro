<p>
In the previous section we built a model of the skeletal dynamics a
forearm. As a first step to implement "torque muscles", we will use a
simple dynamic equation of motion of a single joint arm in a vertical
plane, with gravity:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="figs/onejointarm_muscle.png" alt="onejointarm_muscle.png" width="400px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> Schematic of a simple one-joint arm in a vertical plane with one muscle.</p>
</div>

\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} = m g l_{z} \cos \theta + T_{m}
\end{equation}

<p>
where \(m\) is the mass of the segment, \(g\) is the gravitational
constant (9.81 m/s/s), \(l_{z}\) is the distance of the centre of mass
from the joint, and \(\theta\) and \(\ddot{\theta}\) are joint angular
position and acceleration, respectively. The new term we are now
adding, \(T_{m}\), is the net joint torque due to muscle contraction.
</p>

<p>
Here is what a simple Python function would look like for simulating these dynamics:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">onejointmuscle</span>(state,t,Tm):
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">m</span> = 1.65    <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">kg</span>
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">g</span> = -9.81   <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">m/s/s</span>
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">l</span> = 0.179   <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">metres</span>
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">I</span> = 0.0779  <span style="color: #b22222;"># </span><span style="color: #b22222;">kg m**2</span>
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">a</span> = state[0]
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">ad</span> = state[1]
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">add</span> = (m*g*lz*cos(a) + Tm) / I
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> [ad,add]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can download a full program here that implements a simulation and animation of this version of the arm:

</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline3">Questions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Play with the \(T_{m}\) parameter until you arrive at a value that
maintains the arm at an angle of 30 degrees.</li>

<li>What value of muscle torque \(T_{m}\) is required to maintain the arm
at 45 degrees?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4">Two Antagonistic Torque Muscles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
Now we add a second "muscle" so we have \(T_{mf}\) from a "flexor"
muscle (like biceps brachii) and \(T_{me}\) from an "extensor" muscle
(like triceps brachii).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="figs/onejointarm_muscle2.png" alt="onejointarm_muscle2.png" width="400px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Schematic of a simple one-joint arm in a vertical plane with two antagonistic muscles.</p>
</div>

<p>
Now our dynamics equation looks like this:
</p>

\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} = m g l_{z} \cos \theta + T_{mf} - T_{me}
\end{equation}

<p>
Note how the two muscles act to produce torque in opposite directions.
</p>

<p>
Here is a new version of the Python function:
</p>

  <span style="color: #a0522d;">a</span> = state[0]
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">ad</span> = state[1]
  <span style="color: #a0522d;">add</span> = (m*g*lz*cos(a) + Tmf - Tme) / I
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> [ad,add]

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6">Muscles as Linear Springs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
A very coarse approximation of muscle behaviour is that the muscles
deliver a torque that depends linearly on joint angle. This is
essentially the same as a spring:
</p>

\begin{equation}
T_{m} = -k(\theta-\theta_{0})
\end{equation}


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="figs/onejointarm_muscle3.png" alt="onejointarm_muscle3.png" width="400px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span> Schematic of a simple one-joint arm in a vertical plane with two antagonistic spring-like muscles.</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that for simplicity we are ignoring muscle <a href="http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/ma.shtml">moment arms</a> and we are
assuming they are constant with respect to joint angle.
</p>

<p>
The \(\theta_{0}\) parameter is the "rest length" angle for the elbow joint angle. This is the angle at which the muscles produce no force.
</p>

<p>
You may have noticed that our spring muscles can "push" as well as pull. To fix this we adjust the muscle equation a bit:
</p>

\begin{eqnarray}
T_{flex} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{+} \\
T_{ext} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{-}
\end{eqnarray}

<p>
The notation \(y=\left[x\right]^{+}\) and \(y=\left[x\right]^{-}\) means
that \(y\) is \(x\) when \(x>0\) (and zero otherwise) or \(-x\) when \(x<0\) (or
zero otherwise), respectively.
</p>

<p>
So the equation of motion for linear spring-like muscles is:
</p>

\begin{equation}
I \ddot{\theta} = m g l_{z} \cos\theta + \left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{+} + \left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) \right]^{-}
\end{equation}

<p>
Here is a Python function that implements this:

<h3 id="orgheadline8">Muscles as Linear Spring-Dampers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
A better approximation (yet still too coarse for good predictions
about realistic muscle behaviour) is to incorporate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashpot">damper</a> in the
muscle. A damper is a mechanical unit that delivers an opposing force
that is proportional to velocity. It acts to "damp out" oscillations. Muscle force in a real muscle is also proportional to velocity, but in a more complex way, which we will see later. For now let's assume linear damping:
</p>

\begin{eqnarray}
T_{flex} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) + b \dot{\theta} \right]^{+} \\
T_{ext} &= &\left[ -k(\theta - \theta_{0}) + b \dot{\theta} \right]^{-}

<h2 id="orgheadline11">Introduction to Hill-type muscle models</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline11">
<p>
In reality, muscles show way more complicated behaviour then depicted
in the last section. Over the last decades, several different types of
muscle models have been proposed in the literature. Most commonly used
are the Huxley model (Distrubuted Moments Model) and the Hill-type
muscle model. The main difference between the two models is that the
Huxley model is a structural model, whereas the Hill-type muscle model
is strictly phenomenological. Although both models have their own
specific strengths and weaknesses, in general these models both
describe the dynamic behaviour of real muscles fairly well. Hill-type
muscle models are more frequently used, mainly because they are easier
to implement.

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span> Schematic of a Hill-type muscle model.</p>
</div>

<p>
The Hill-type muscle model is build around three elements: a parallel
elastic element (PE) a contractile element (CE) and a serial element
(SE). The PE represents the collagen tissue that is present in the
muscle belly. The CE represents the actual contractile properties of
the muscle and the SE represents all the tendinous tissue in series
with the CE. Below, a short simplified description of the elements is
provided.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline12">The SE</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline12">
<p>
Collagen tissue is a passive material that behaves like a non-linear
spring. Although the behavior of a tendon (or aponeurosis, etc) is
quite complex, the "normal" working range is well described by a
quadratic spring:
</p>

\begin{equation}
F_{SE} = \left( \left[ k_{SE}(l_{SE_0} - l_{SE}) \right]^{+} \right)^{2}
\end{equation}

<p>
Here, \(k_{SE}\) is the tendon stiffness, \(l_{SE}\) the tendon length and
\(l_{SE_0}\) the tendon slack length. \(k_{SE}\) is usually measured in
vivo using very fast perturbations, for example using the so-called
"quick-release experiment":

<p>
The slack length of tendons are muscle specific and are in general
measured in cadaver studies. Here is an example of the (relative)
force-length curve of a SE:

<h3 id="orgheadline13">The CE: the force-length relationship</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline13">
<p>
Due to their contractile proteins (actin and myosin, etc.), muscles
are capable of actively generating force. In contrast with the Huxley
model, the Hill-type muscle model does not model the interactions of
the proteins themselves, but rather the experimentally observed
mechanical behaviour of these interactions. Two salient mechanical
phenomena are typically observed in muscles: the force-length
relationship and the force-velocity relationship. To keep things
computationally simple, without harming the descriptive power of the
model too much, the isometric force-length relationship is often
described by a parabola:
</p>

The dashed line represents the isometric force when the muscle is stimulated half the maximum. Depicted is also the PE force. Note that the l<sub>PE</sub> is equal to l<sub>CE</sub>. The total force-length relationship is the sum of the active CE and passive PE force-length relationship. Also shown is the passive force of the PE: a quadratic spring that is similar to that of the SE.</p>
</div>

<p>
The maximal isometric force of a real muscle can be estimated from
cadaver studies by counting the amount of sarcomeres in parallel (or
measuring the physiological cross-sectional area). The optimum length
of a muscle can be estimated by counting the amount of sarcomeres in
series, see for example:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline14">
<p>
The force-velocity relationship is a bit more difficult that the
force-length relationship. This relationship describes the phenomenon
that the (maximal) force that muscles can deliver depends on the speed
with which they contract. If the muscle shortens (concentric
contraction), the maximal force decreases and if the muscle lengthens
(eccentric contraction) the maximal force increases:

<h3 id="orgheadline15">Modeling the interaction between muscle and skeleton</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline15">
<p>
In the previous section we have implicitly assumed that the "length"
of the torque muscles change linearly with joint angle. In reality,
the length of the whole muscle (i.e. the muscle tendon complex length
l<sub>MTC</sub>), depends also its origin and insertion and on the anatomy of
the structures it is crossing. The relationship between l<sub>MTC</sub> and
joint angle is obtained in cadaver studies using a very elegant
technique proposed by Grieve et al. in 1978 (Biomechanics VI-A,
International series on Biomechanics, University Park Press,
Baltimore). First, at a reference position, the l<sub>MTC</sub> of a muscle is
measured. Then, a piece of tendon is cut out and removed, and the
distance between the two remaining parts is measured as a function of
joint angle. The obtained data gives the change of l<sub>MTC</sub> as a function
of the angle. Together with the reference length, the kinematic
relationship between l<sub>MTC</sub> and joint angle is known. But what about
the mechanical interaction?
</p>

<p>
The muscles deliver a torque on the skeleton. The torque delivered by
a muscle equals the force they deliver multiplied with the moment arm
(lever arm) of that muscle. But what about the moment arms of real
muscles? The nice thing about measuring l<sub>MTC</sub> as a function of joint
angle, is that one gets the moment arm as a function of joint angle
for free! Using the principle of "virtual energy", one can easily
deduce that the moment arm equals the change in muscle length divided
by the change in joint angle (thus, the derivative of l<sub>MTC</sub> with
respect to joint angle:
</p>

\begin{equation}
momentarm = \frac{\partial l_{MTC}}{\partial \theta}

Over the last decades several changes have been suggested to improve
the predictive capacities of the Hill-type muscle model. For the

<p>
In addition to the Hill-type muscle model, a model of activation
dynamics is added. Activation dynamics is the process that takes place
when an action potential arrives at a muscle. This AP causes the
release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum in the intercellular
which leads to free binding places for cross-bridges between actin and
myosin.

<h2 id="orgheadline17">How are muscles controlled?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline17">
<p>
Once we have a physiologically realistic model of muscle force
generation, the question arises, how does the brain control movement?
How does the brain determine what time-varying patterns of stimulaton
to send down to muscles, in order to generate a desired movement?
</p>

<p>
A key insight is that there are many complex, non-linear relationships
that sit in between neural control signals to muscles, and the arm
movement that ultimately results. These include muscle mechanical
properties that we have seen like force-length and force-velocity
relationships, joint angle-dependent muscle moment arms, and there are
many others including gradual development of muscle force over time
(due to calcium kinetics), and dynamics introduced by series elastic
elements (e.g. tendons).
</p>

<p>
Something we haven't talked about much yet is that the activation of
spinal motoneurones controlling a muscle is determined not only by
central efferent neural control signals but is also influence by
afferent signals such as those from muscle spindles, golgi tendon
organs, and signals from spinal interneurons. Thus the activation
signal that gets ultimately sent to activate a muscle is determined by
a very complex interplay between central efferent "control" signals,
properties of the neuromuscular "plant", and afferent feedback
signals.
</p>

<p>
Once you start to build up computational models that include all of
these features in a realistic way, it's practically (and in some cases
theoretically) impossible to "invert the system", and derive equations
that give the neural control signals for a given desired movement. One
influential model of motor control that proposes a physiologically
motivated solution to the problem of how the brain controls movement,
given these complexities, is the Equilibrium-Point Hypothesis.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline18" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline18">Equilibrium-Point Control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline18">
<p>
Something you may have noticed about the simplified arm models
presented above, is that when you have opposing muscles around a
joint, the balance of forces between the two muscles defines an
equilibrium joint angle - an angle for which the joint torques
balance. According to the <b>Equilibrium Point Hypothesis</b>, movement
arises by neurally controlled shifts in the equilibrium position of
the limb from one static posture to another. Descending neural control
signals define an equilibrium position for the limb, and movement is
produced by gradually shifting this centrally specified equilibrium
position over time.
</p>

<p>
Patterns of time varying muscle forces (and hence muscle activation
patterns as measured by EMG) are not explicitly planned by the nervous
system but rather unfold as a natural consequence of the shifting
equilibrium position of the limb and the spring-like properties of
neurally activated muscle. This arrangement greatly simplifies the
task of movement planning, eliminating the need to perform the often
complex, nonlinear "inversions" required in order to explicitly
specify the dynamics of multi-joint movement.
</p>

<p>
Two main variants of the EP hypothesis have been offered, and are
known as the \(\alpha\) and \(\lambda\) versions. Original proposals have
centered around the control of movements at a single joint such as the
elbow. According to the α version of the model proposed by Bizzi and
colleagues, descending control signals specify levels of \(\alpha\)
motoneurone (MN) activity for antagonist muscles about a joint. For a
given level of flexor and extensor MN activity, an equilibrium joint
angle is specified as the angle at which flexor and extensor forces
balance. Movement is produced from one joint angle to another through
reciprocal changes to the balance of flexor and extensor MN
activity. As the balance of forces change, the limb moves to a new
position at which muscle forces, as defined by the new levels of
flexor and extensor MN activation, balance. In addition joint
stiffness may be controlled independent of movement through
simultaneous increases or decreases in flexor and extensor MN
activation, leading to muscle cocontraction around a joint.
</p>

<p>
In the \(\alpha\) version of the EP hypothesis proprioception and
afferent feedback play a limited role in MN activation, which is
determined wholly by descending control signals. This assumption is
based on studies of head movement and single joint elbow movement in
monkeys showing that when unexpected loads are applied during
movement, final position is not achieved until the loads are removed
(Bizzi, Polit, &amp; Morasso, 1976; Bizzi, Dev, Morasso, &amp; Polit,
1978). In other words, load dependent changes in proprioceptive input
did not alter neural input to muscles. Additional studies on
deafferented animals showed that motor performance was relatively
unaffected when proprioceptive input was eliminated altogether (Polit
&amp; Bizzi, 1978; Polit &amp; Bizzi, 1979), supporting the idea that afferent
information plays a minimal role in the achievement of final limb
position. It should be noted however that normal execution of movement
in the deafferented preparation was dependent on the animal having
knowledge (through vision) of the initial position of their limb
relative to the body. This suggests that even under these conditions
afferent information plays some role in programming limb movement. The
α version is a force control model since it posits that the centrally
controlled variable is MN activation.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the \(\alpha\) version, in the \(\lambda\) version of the
EP hypothesis proprioception plays a central role in movement, and in
particular in determining MN activation levels. Consistent with
physiological studies (see Houk &amp; Rymer, 1981 and Rothwell, 1994 for
reviews), in the \(\lambda\) version MN activation is determined by both
central drive and afferent feedback from muscle spindles (Feldman,
Adamovich, Ostry, &amp; Flanagan, 1990). Descending control signals
specify a threshold joint angle for MN recruitment (\(\lambda\)), such
that as the difference between the current joint angle and \(\lambda\)
increases, MN activation and muscle force increase. The physiological
mechanism underlying this increase is assumed to be the tonic stretch
reflex (Feldman, Adamovich, Ostry, &amp; Flanagan, 1990). Thus in contrast
to the \(\alpha\) version, in the \(\lambda\) model EMG activity is a
consequence of the shifting equilibrium and afferent reflexes, rather
than a quantity under direct central control.
</p>

<p>
An appealing property of EP models is that at their heart they include
the interaction between central efferent control signals and afferent
signals, and their dual influence on muscle forces and movement.

<h3 id="orgheadline19">Force Control Models</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline19">
<p>
In force control models, the hypothesis is that the brain is able to
compute open-loop (no feedback) neural control signals to muscles for
a given movement by using so-called "internal models" of the
neuromuscular plant. This is an old concept from engineering and
robotics that has been recently applied to the neural control of
movement by the brain. The idea is that through experience, the brain
learns an accurate "input-output" map of the motor system: the
relationship between control inputs and motor outputs. This is known
as a <i>forward model</i>. In these models the brain also has a neural
representation of the <i>inverse model</i>, where given a desired movement
the brain uses the inverse model to compute required control signals
that produce that movement. The proposal also involves the idea that
the brain can use the forward model to <i>predict</i> the consequences of a
given motor command, and use that prediction as a proxy for feedback
of the actual movement (which is delayed due to neural feedback
delays, which can be quite long), to update the command, and hence
achieve motor learning.
</p>

<p>
A major challenge to this class of models, in particular the idea of
an inverse model, is centered around the criticism that a full
characterization of the complete dynamics of the full-blown
neuromuscular system, and a neural representation of its inverse, is
wildly unrealistic. There is much empirical evidence that the motor
system engages in "prediction" of the consquences of motor commands,
and hence the idea of a forward model, at least in principle, is less
controversial.

There is debate about the extent to which "pure" EP models can account
for features of motor control and motor learning such as compensation
for interaction torques, and motor learning. Thus hybrid models have
been proposed in which there is a combination of "adjustable"
open-loop control signals and EP-style feedback-control signals. This
however does not solve the question of how the brain learns to shape
the open-loop control signals.

One of the challenges in the motor system when we start to think about
learning from errors, is that movement errors are in a different
coordinate frame than the control signals that lead to those
errors. When our brain "guesses" at the control signals necessary to
stimulate our arm muscles so that we throw a basketball towards a net,
and we miss the net to the right, the motor error is in cartesian
coordinates (the ball was 10 cm too high). How do we transform that
"distal" error into an appropriate change in neural control signal to
arm muscles?

that first, a forward model is trained, for example by "motor
babbling". The brain sends out (initially incorrect) motor commands,
but monitors the input/output relationships, and models that, in the
form of a forward model. Once trained even to a partial extent, the
forward model is able to predict (at least partially) the motor output
given a motor command input. Once the forward model is trained at
least to be partially accurate, it can be used to transform motor
errors into required changes in motor commands.

<p>
Another interesting theory called <i>feedback error learning</i> proposes
that the CNS uses afferent feedback signals from a simplistic (and
only partially accurate) feedback controller (e.g. at the spinal cord)
as a "teaching signal" to train an accurate central neural controller.

We will return to the question of motor learning after we talk about
neural network models and learning more generally.
